seg.py
to run: $ python seg.py filename.extension kvalue


input: the image file you would like to perform the k-means algorithm on and a number K that will decide the K-means algorithm used

output: prints to terminal the average of mean squared error for the 15 iterations of that k value as well as the minimum. displays a window with the original image on the left and the new image based on the new clustering on the right. 


---------------------------------------------------
kmeans.py

you do not run this seperately it is called by seg.py

note: I made an addition to this function to calculate the error so it is pertinent that you run this version of kmeans.py and not the one that was given on canvas.
